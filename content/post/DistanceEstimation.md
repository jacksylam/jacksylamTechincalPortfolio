This was a project to see how having 20/20 visual acuity in a hybrid reality environment may impact a user's distance estimation.

Participants had to shoot a balloon at various distances with their controller and then move two steps to the side then proceed to shoot at the balloon's last known location. Â By using trigonometry, we are able to see how accurate participants are in judging the target's distance with positive and zero parallax.

We found that there is a large amount of distance underestimation with positive parallax. Participants were also unable to discern distances when there is zero parallax.
