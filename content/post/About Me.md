At LAVA, I had to collaborate with computer scientists, engineers, and artists to build stunning visualizations utilizing cutting edge technology. During this time, I studied big data visualization, virtual reality, augmented reality, hybrid reality, and hydrology.

In addition, I was a teaching assistant for the Computer Science Discrete Math courses.

I obtained my B.S. in Computer Science in 2013 at the University of Hawaiʻi at Manoa. During this time, I worked as a Computer and Network Technician at the University Library.
