This was a group project where we designed and implemented a website to bring consumers and farmers together.

<!--more-->

Using the Play framework, we built a responsive website that allows consumers to look at farmers' inventory of fresh fruits and vegetables at farmer's markets. The website also allows users to find recipes that they can create and form a meal plan.

Farmers are also able to update their online inventory and show how fresh their produce is.

I contributed to this project by developing the frontend and assisted in developing the database backend for creating and managing the data.
