This was a group project involving computer scientists, animators, and marine biologists to produce a museum exhibit that teaches the public about the harm of algae in coral reefs at the Imiloa Astronomy Center of Hawaii.
<!--more-->

Our exhibit allowed participants to use a Microsoft Kinect to interact with the narrator and control a underwater vacuum to clean coral reefs. The narrator would show the participant what types of marine sea creatures help the coral reefs and explain why an excess of algae is harmful for the environment.
